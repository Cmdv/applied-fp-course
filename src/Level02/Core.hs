-- | Some helper functions to make our lives a little more DRY.
mkResponse
  :: Status
  -> ContentType
  -> LBS.ByteString
  -> Response
mkResponse =
  error "mkResponse not implemented"

  :: ContentType
  -> LBS.ByteString

  error "resp400 not implemented"

-- These next few functions will take raw request information and construct one
-- of our types.
mkAddRequest
  :: Text
  -> LBS.ByteString
  -> Either Error RqType
mkAddRequest =
  error "mkAddRequest not implemented"
  where
    -- This is a helper function to assist us in going from a Lazy ByteString, to a Strict Text
    lazyByteStringToStrictText =
      decodeUtf8 . LBS.toStrict

-- This has a number of benefits, we're able to isolate our validation
-- requirements into smaller components that are simpler to maintain and verify.
-- It also allows for greater reuse and it also means that validation is not
-- duplicated across the application, maybe incorrectly.
mkViewRequest
  :: Text
  -> Either Error RqType
mkViewRequest =
  error "mkViewRequest not implemented"

mkListRequest
  :: Either Error RqType
mkListRequest =
  error "mkListRequest not implemented"

mkErrorResponse
  :: Error
  -> Response
mkErrorResponse =
  error "mkErrorResponse not implemented"

-- Use our ``RqType`` helpers to write a function that will take the input
-- ``Request`` from the Wai library and turn it into something our application
-- cares about.
mkRequest
  :: Request
  -> IO ( Either Error RqType )
mkRequest =
  -- Remembering your pattern-matching skills will let you implement the entire
  -- specification in this function.
  error "mkRequest not implemented"

-- If we find that we need more information to handle a request, or we have a
-- new type of request that we'd like to handle then we update the ``RqType``
-- structure and the compiler will let us know which parts of our application
-- are affected.
--
-- Reduction of concerns such that each section of the application only deals
-- with a small piece is one of the benefits of developing in this way.
--
-- For now, return a made-up value for each of the responses as we don't have
-- any persistent storage. Plain text responses that contain "X not implemented
-- yet" should be sufficient.
