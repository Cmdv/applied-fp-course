# Level 03

In this exercise we're going to add some tests to our application. Because types
are awesome, and tests are pretty good. But types AND tests is pretty much
perfect.

These tests will not be awe inspiring, this exercise is primarily to introduce
you to adding tests to your Haskell application. The setup of the Cabal file is
already completed for you, but will be covered.

As is to be expected, there are multiple testing frameworks and packages
available but we will only cover one here. We will use the [HSpec] framework,
with the [hspec-wai] package to make our lives a bit easier.

### Including Test Library Dependencies and Running the Tests

To run the tests we first need to uncomment the required functions in
`test/Test.hs` otherwise nothing will be run! We do this so you don't have to
worry about tests you haven't written yet.

For a cabal sandbox:

```shell
$ cabal sandbox init
$ cabal install --only-dependencies --enable-tests
$ cabal configure --enable-tests
$ cabal test
```

If you're using Cabal 2.0 or greater (You can check your cabal version with `$ cabal --version`):

```shell
$ cabal new-configure --enable-tests
$ cabal new-build --enable-tests
$ cabal new-test
```

For a stack environment:

```shell
$ stack build --test
```

To load the tests in the REPL:

```shell
# Cabal
$ cabal new-repl app-fp-tests

# Stack
$ stack ghci applied-fp-course:test:app-fp-tests
```

If you want to run the tests using the REPL, you can use the following command
in the REPL:

```shell
*Main> :main
```

Start in ``tests/Level03Tests.hs``.
