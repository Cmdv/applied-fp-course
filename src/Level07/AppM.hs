-- First, let's clean up our (Conf,FirstAppDB) with an application Env type. We
-- will add a general purpose logging function as well. Remember that functions
-- are values, we're able to pass them around and place them on records like any
-- other type.
data Env = Env

  -- We will add a function to take some 'Text' input and print it to the
  -- console as a crude form of logging. Construct a function that matches this
  -- type so you can include it when you create the 'Env'.
  { envLoggingFn :: Text -> AppM ()

  -- We're able to nest records to keep things neat and tidy.
  , envConfig    :: Conf
  , envDB        :: FirstAppDB
  }

-- It would be nice to remove the need to pass around our Env to every function
-- that needs it. Wouldn't it be great to have our functions run where we could
-- simply ask for the current Env?
--
-- We can create this by wrapping a function in a newtype like so:
--
-- This gives us a type that declares this function has access to our Env, and
-- will do something involving IO. It's another form of documentation and type
-- safety. AppM only has one definition and so we can easily understand what it
-- implies when used in our application.
newtype AppM a = AppM ( Env -> IO (Either Error a) )
  -- Quite often, GHC is able to write the code for us. In this case we just
  -- tell GHC that we want a Functor instance for our newtype, and it is able to
  -- correctly derive what is needed.
  deriving Functor
  -- We could do this for the rest of these instances, but that would turn into
  -- "magic" what is otherwise straight-forward implementations. You are here to
  -- learn after all.
