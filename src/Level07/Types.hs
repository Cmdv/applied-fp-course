-- Our application will be able to load configuration from both a file and
-- command line input. We want to be able to use the command line to temporarily
-- override the configuration from our file. How do we combine the different
-- inputs to enable this property?

-- We want the command line configuration to take precedence over the File
-- configuration, so if we think about combining each of our ``Conf`` records,
-- we want to be able to write something like this:

-- ``defaults <> file <> commandLine``

-- We can use the ``Monoid`` typeclass to handle combining the ``Conf`` records
-- together, and the ``Last`` type to wrap up our values to handle the desired
-- precedence. The ``Last`` type is a wrapper for Maybe that when used with its
-- ``Monoid`` instance will always preference the last ``Just`` value that it
-- has:

-- Last (Just 3) <> Last (Just 1) = Last (Just 1)
-- Last Nothing  <> Last (Just 1) = Last (Just 1)
-- Last (Just 1) <> Last Nothing  = Last (Just 1)

-- To make this easier, we'll make a new type ``PartialConf`` that will have our
-- ``Last`` wrapped values. We can then define a ``Monoid`` instance for it and
-- have our ``Conf`` be a known good configuration.

-- on the ``Semigroup`` instance for Last to always get the last value.

-- define our always empty configuration, which would always fail our
-- requirements. We just define `mappend` to be an alias of ``(<>)``

-- When it comes to reading the configuration options from the command-line, we
-- use the 'optparse-applicative' package. This part of the exercise has already
-- been completed for you, feel free to have a look through the 'CommandLine'
-- module and see how it works.
--
-- For reading the configuration from the file, we're going to use the aeson
